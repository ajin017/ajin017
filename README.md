>Web scraping is defined as the process of gathering information from the internet by extracting underlying HTML code and the data stored in a database. The scraper can then replicate the entire website content as and wherever needed.

a.First, you need to provide the Web Scraper with the URLs to load up before the actual process of scraping could start. As soon as it receives it, the scraper starts loading the complete HTML code for the link you have shared.
b.Moving on, the Web Scraper extracts either all the data available on the page or the specific parts of data selected by you before starting the process.
c.In the end, the Web Scraper provides you with all the data it has collected in a usable format.
